# MidsideProject
 
This is a plugin for digital audio workstations (DAWs) that applies mid-side processing to an audio signal. The plugin is built using the JUCE framework and written in C++.

<h1>Features</h1>

Control the balance between the center (mid) and side channels of the stereo signal
Adjust the width of the stereo image
Process both mono and stereo signals
Cutoff control 



<h1>Usage</h1>

Choose the appropriate input option, either stereo or mid-side, and then select the desired output option, which can also be either stereo or mid-side.
Adjust the Stereo Width control to change the width of the stereo image. A value of 0.0 will output a mono signal, a value of 1.0 will output the original stereo signal, and values between 0.0 and 1.0 will output a widened or narrowed stereo image.
